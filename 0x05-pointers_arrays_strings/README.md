This project is part of the curriculum of the low-level programming track at ALX school. It covers pointers, arrays, and strings in the C programming language. The main objective of the project is to learn how to use and manipulate these concepts, as well as understand their differences and how to work with them.

The project has nine mandatory tasks:

0. Write a function named reset_to_98 that takes a pointer to an int as parameter and updates the value it points to to 98.

1. Write a function named swap_int that swaps the values of two integers.

2. Write a function named _strlen that returns the length of a string.

3. Write a function named _puts that prints a string, followed by a new line, to stdout.

4. Write a function named print_rev that prints a string, in reverse, followed by a new line.

5. Write a function named rev_string that reverses a string.

6. Write a function named puts2 that prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character.

7. Write a function named puts_half that prints the second half of a string.

8. Write a function named puts_half that prints the second half of a string.

9. Write a function named print_array that prints n elements of an array of integers.i
